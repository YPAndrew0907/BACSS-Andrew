# Goodreads Scraper Methodology

This document outlines the methodology used in the Goodreads Review Scraper project.

## Data Collection Approach

The scraper follows these steps to collect review data:

1. **Book Lookup**: Using the book title and author, the scraper searches Goodreads to find the correct book page URL.
   - Fuzzy string matching is used to handle slight variations in titles and author names
   - A similarity threshold ensures high-quality matches

2. **Review Extraction**: Once the book URL is identified, the scraper navigates to the reviews page and extracts:
   - Review text
   - Rating (1-5 stars)
   - Reviewer information
   - Review date
   - Number of likes
   - Additional metadata

3. **Data Processing**: The collected data is processed and structured into a consistent format
   - Reviews are cleaned and normalized
   - Missing values are handled appropriately
   - Data is saved in CSV format for analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Rate Limiting and Compliance

The scraper is designed to be respectful of Goodreads' terms of service:

- Implements appropriate rate limiting (2-second delay between requests)
- Respects robots.txt directives
- Uses a realistic user agent string
- Implements exponential backoff for retries

### Error Handling

Robust error handling ensures reliable data collection:

- Connection errors trigger automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting (429) responses are handled with increased delays
- Parsing errors are logged for manual review
- Caching of responses allows for debugging without additional requests

### Performance Considerations

The scraper is optimized for both reliability and performance:

- Caching reduces redundant requests
- Batch processing allows for efficient handling of large datasets
- Progress tracking provides visibility into the scraping process
- Memory management techniques prevent issues with large datasets

## Limitations

- The scraper cannot access JavaScript-loaded content without additional tools
- Some reviews may be missed if they're loaded dynamically
- Goodreads may change their site structure, requiring updates to the scraper
- Anti-scraping measures may occasionally block the scraper

## Ethical Considerations

This scraper is designed for research and educational purposes only:

- Use responsibly and in accordance with Goodreads' terms of service
- Do not overload the Goodreads servers with excessive requests
- Consider the privacy implications of collecting and storing review data
- Properly attribute data to Goodreads when using it in research or analysis
